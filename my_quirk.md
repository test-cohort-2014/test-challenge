My quirk is that I check my shoes for scorpions before I put them on. My house is near the woods, so its not uncommon to find snakes or scorpions after it rains of there's been a fire. I've foung three scorpions already, and almost sat or stepped on them. So i just shake my shoes before putting them on so as not to get an unpleasant surprise.
