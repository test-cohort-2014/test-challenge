I have recently obtained a new found obsession of soup. Maybe due to the **cold** temperatures here in [Chicago](https://www.google.com/search?q=chicago+current+temperature&oq=chicago+current+tem&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.23388j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8) 
compared to [Hawaii](https://www.google.com/search?q=chicago+current+temperature&oq=chicago+current+tem&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.23388j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8#q=hawaii+current+temperature), 
or maybe just because I love it. In the past week I went through over 12 cans of soup with no let up in sight.
