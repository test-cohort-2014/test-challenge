#### Quirkiness

One of my quirks is that I am constantly lost.  I've displayed this visually using examples of maps on my website [coolin.us](http://www.coolin.us).  I need GPS to get everywhere and, when I don't have a GPS device, I spend a significant amount of time lost/worried if I'll every find my way.
