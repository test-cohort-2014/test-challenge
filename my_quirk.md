##Personal Quirk:

**I have a terrible fear of heights**, yet many of my interests revolve around pushing myself to experience and embrace that fear. I've almost completed training for a helicopter pilot's license. I recently took a tandem skydive jump, and can't wait to do AFF and work towards a class A license. I used to rock climb a fair bit, and I love getting a bit airborne on my snowboard. *I dread the feeling of heights, but I love the excitement!*
