One quirk I have is my habit of finding and downloading themes from various favorite broadcast programs/movies (could be sports shows/programming, 90's shows theme songs, newscast themes, etc.) and then using them as pump-up songs during workouts. (Hey, the Caddyshack theme by Kenny Loggins is a great half-miler!)
