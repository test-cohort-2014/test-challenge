My Quirk

I'm not afraid to try (most) new food. Whenever I go grocery shopping, if I see
a candy at the counter that I've never seen before, I have the habit of buying it 
and trying it out. Even if it's good, chances are I'd just try something new next 
time rather than revisiting the same stuff.

Other "wierd stuff I've had includes sea stars (they're terrible), 
centipedes (they taste like chitin with no flavor), scorpians (these are actually good. distinct taste), cicada (they're not bad... quite unique), crickets (tastes like roasted seaweed), 
locust (tastes like grass flavored chitin. would not eat again), etc. You get the idea.

If I ever run across more "wierd" stuff, I'd probably try them out too
