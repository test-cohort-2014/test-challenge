At the end of the day, even if i'm too tired to watch a 2 hour long movie
I seem to have no problem watching an entire season of a really good tv show.

### Tiffany Kaiser

I really like bad movies. A few favorites are "The Room", "Hausu", "Troll 3" and "Sharknado." I also really like British TV shows like "The IT Crowd" and "Black Books."
