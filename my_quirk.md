I'm teaching myself Norwegian. It's suprisingly similar to English and quite easy to pick up! For example, there is minimal conjugation within tenses:

Infinitive: å smile (to smile. 'Å' is somewhere between the English 'oh' and 'aw'. Pronounce the first syllable of 'awful' with a British accent and you'll have it.)

Present: (subject) smiler. 
Example: Jeg smiler. (I smile)

Simple Future: (suject) skal smile. OR (subject) kommer til å smile.
Examples: 1. Du skal smile. (You shall smile. Note the similarity between 'skal' and 'shall'. In Norwegian, the combination 'sk' is sometimes even pronounced like the English 'sh'. Fun example: skitt (dirt).)
2. Hun kommer til å smile. (She is going to smile.)

Past: (subject) smilte.
Example: Vi smilte. (We smiled)

Perfect: (subject) har smilt.
Example: De har smilt. (They smiled)
