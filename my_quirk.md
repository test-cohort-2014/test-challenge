###Mathilde Mouw's Quirk

*My quirky interest is knitting.* Right now I am working on a grey and red mini-tapestry with an edge pattern that looks like castle turrets. I like making my own patterns and experimenting with textures and colors.  

###My knitting philosophy

*Knitting pleases and relaxes me.* Without a pattern and a set end vision, there is no pressure to hurry through a knitting project. Sometimes when I finish something I look at it and I don't like how it turned out so I unravel it. My knitting expertise flourishes with each experience of making a peice, even when the piece is not destined to stay in the finished collection.
