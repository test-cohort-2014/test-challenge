##Hi!

I am particular about tidiness around my house. It's important to me.

As an economist, I (try to) make decisions through the lens of efficiency, meaning I disregard my own and other people's preferences and focus on what is most egalitarian/optimized, even if the result is something my preferences and biases would not lead me towards.

1 thing I want to change about myself is exercising more frequently.

I love Bikram Yoga and running.

I'm community-oriented.
