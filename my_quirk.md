I'm left-handed. This is seldom a problem, until:

- I'm required to eat at a crowded dinner table alongside right-handed diners
- I use a writing pen with very liquid ink, such as whiteboard markers. The edge of my hand ends up smearing the ink.
- Somebody sits at my left side to pair-program with me. This restricts the motion in my dominant hand and feels oppressive.
