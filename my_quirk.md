I'm addicted to games like chess and backgammon.  Every couple years I binge and play for hours and even read strategy guides on the topic.  Then I won't play a game for years. But I always return!

Ditto for Erik's comment. Minus the backgammon. There is a cool chess app out there that shows your top three moves, were a grandmaster playing, but you can still choose any move. You can toggle between displaying them or not and I find it very handy in learning to not-display, think through what you best move is, and only then compare with the given top three. 

I'm not that great, so I always doubted the grand master's suggestions. Luckily you can use a lightweight version manager to take back moves (it's not cheating if it's for the sake of science - and you're playing against a computer!), and retroactively analyze the faults in your initial approach and the strengths of the computer's even if it's several moves ahead. 

I love technology.
