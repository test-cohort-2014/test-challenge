I can debone a pig head in under two minutes. I eat everything except raw celery and truffle oil. I am growing portobello mushrooms in my house. I maintain water kefir grains and a sourdough starter. I have a bunny named Pat the Bunny and he is cooler than me. I love Stevie Nicks and Amy Winehouse.
