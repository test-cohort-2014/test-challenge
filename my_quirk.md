Caroline's Quirk
-

In elementary school I wrote a detailed account of a ficticious trip to Cali in which my girlfriends and I panned for gold. Here is a little excerpt...excuse the spelling.

> ...Funny we were the only girls there? Well ther were 17 moor girls there but none were mining they were telling ther husbends '**go faster, hery up, I'm getting tired and I want gold!**'
