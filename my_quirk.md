####well dbc, im super excited to move to sf and start my cohort!
my quirk is wikipedia. i straight up read wikipedia articles when im bored.
they usually pertain to something im interested in, like chemistry, or my favorite bands.
i love learning and random facts and reading all these articles satisfies both these curiosities.
