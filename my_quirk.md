### My Quirk
My name is Jackson Behan and sometimes in conversation, something being said will prompt me to quote a movie, tv show or stand up bit. A lot of times I doubt the other person will get the reference because a lot of the time they are very obscure but I'll do it anyway and just seem weird, but when someone gets the reference it makes me very happy.
