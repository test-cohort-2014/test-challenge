###My Quirk

It's not really a quirk but between 1842 and 1843, I translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea on the engine, which I supplemented with an elaborate set of notes of my own, simply called Notes. These notes contain what many consider to be the first computer programâ€”that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. My notes are apparently important in the early history of computers!
