###The Bathroom

I have a couple of quirks regarding the bathroom and toiletries. First, toothpaste MUST be squeezed from the bottom of the tube. If you squeeze from the middle, you don't get all the toothpaste. And even worse, if the toothpaste is striped, eventually the stripes will start to get messed up. Second, I cannot deal well with toilet paper that feeds from the bottom of the roll. It's supposed to dispense by coming over the top of the roll. That's the only option. If it's on the wrong way, I will fix it in the bathroom I'm in, be it public or my own bathroom because my girlfriend switched it to frustrate me. Third, I can't deal well with people stepping out of the shower dripping wet. It gets the bathroom mat all wet, and then I walk on it with socks and get my socks wet. I hate wet socks. My siblings apparently didn't use a towel after they showered while we were growing up, so the mat was always wet. Now I dry off completely in the shower and then dry the bottoms of my feet before stepping on the mat.
