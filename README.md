#Git and Github Submission Challenge

## Learning Goals
* Create and push a git branch to GitHub
* Use commands such as `git status`, `git branch`, and `git checkout` to manage and switch between branches
* Navigate GitHub.com to review repos, pull requests, and comments on pull requests


##Summary

Every challenge will have a summary, an overview of what the challenge entails.  In this challenge, you'll be using git and github to submit a solution, review other solutions, and also review comments posted on solutions.

##Releases

###Release 0 - Submit a simple markdown file

Challenges will usually have multiple releases or incremental versions of the challenge.  Sometimes, a release can be an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) or an initial collection of features.

In this release, you are tasked with creating a markdown file that contains a couple sentences explaining something quirky about you.  For full instructions on how to update and submit your file, please see the [original instructions](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/challenges/497) in Socrates.

SUPER GOOD!
